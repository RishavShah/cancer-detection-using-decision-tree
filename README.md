# cancer-detection-using-decision-tree
Detects whether the cancerous cell is benign or malignant with the help of decision tree.
Here there are three python file namely DecisionTree.py , main.py and node.py.
DecisionTree.py contain all the functions required to generate decision tree.
Node.py keeps the record of child nodes.
main.py contains main method which initiates the program.

First run DecisionTree.py then run node.py followed by main.py. This will generate another program named program.py and once you run program.py you get which cell is benign and which is malignant.
